## Why?

I was very bored at work and wanted to play a new wordle but it only refreshes once a day.

Also, it looked like a fun little coding project!

## How to run

Open the "index.html" file, it should open your default browser.

Random word is picked every time you refresh so you can continue to play and lose again and again and again!

## Where did you get the words from?

Dictionary has to be manually updated unfortunately, so if there are missing words, feel free to add them yourself.

Words acquired from: https://wordfind.com/length/5-letter-words/

## HELP! It doesn't work!

Odds are its something to do with software privileges (which can be easily fixed by running as a system admin, though you shouldn't have to do that!).

If something continues to not work and it's not clear why, feel free to contact me on twitter @henryishuman.

## It works, but your code is bad and horrid.

I know.. Please feel free to go over to my github and bully me endlessly. 

If you can see a better way of doing something, please do tell me. I will never learn and continue to commit all kinds of sin otherwise.
